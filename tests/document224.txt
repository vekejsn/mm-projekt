Beef Tips in Gravy on Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes
Throw your pressure cooker with an open lid onto high heat or turn it onto saute mode if it’s electric
Chop up the fat into very small, uniform cubes or strips and begin to saute it in the pressure cooker
Chop up your meat into medium, uniform cubes or strips and add it to the fat
Optional: If you are not using red wine as a deglaze in step 7 or are not cooking a large amount (~2+ pounds/~1+ kg) of meat, you may want to add a teaspoon or so of beef bouillon into the pressure cooker to intensify the beef flavor of the gravy
Add a generous amount of salt and pepper to taste along with a tiny pinch of garlic powder and stir (be very conservative with the garlic powder)
Once the meat is sufficiently browned off and there is a nice glaze forming on the bottom of the cooker, deglaze the cooker using hot water or red wine (optional) for more flavor.
Put the top on your pressure cooker and allow the meat to cook for around 30 minutes on low heat while you prepare your mashed potatoes
After half an hour, vent your pressure cooker, remove the lid, and put the cooker back on low heat
Add a small amount of hot water until the liquid in the cooker is a bit more than the amount of gravy you want, then allow it to come to a boil
In a small bowl, mix up some flour with warm water to the consistency of a very runny batter
Very slowly begin adding flour water into the pot while constantly stirring until the gravy thickens and reaches the consistency you desire (it’s very easy to overthicken the gravy here, don’t overdo it!)
Turn off the heat and plate on top of your sour cream mashed potatoes, shown below
