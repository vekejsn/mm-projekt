Frijol con puerco
In a large pot, put the black beans and 6 liters of water.
Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook, with the lid half-open, for 45 minutes.
Add the pork, onion, epazote or cilantro, and salt.
Stir well. Cook for another hour and a half, with the pot partially covered, until the pork is cooked and tender.
Make sure the broth does not dry out. You can add about 4 extra cups of boiling water after adding the pork.
Put out the fire. Make sure the seasoning is OK.
Serve the beans with pork with the radishes, cilantro, avocado, lemons, chiltomate sauce and habaneros.
Enjoy with some authentic mexican tortillas.
