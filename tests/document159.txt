Add all ingredients into a pan.
Put it under low heat and stir it (preferably with a wooden spoon) until it stops sticking to the bottom of the pan.
Remove it from the pan and eat it with a spoon or roll it into small balls.
If you chose to roll it into balls, you may also roll them around in sprinkles while still hot.
