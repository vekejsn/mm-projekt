Creamy Mashed Potatoes
Peel and cut the potatoes into medium sized pieces.
Put the potatoes in a pot with some water so that it covers the potatoes and
boil them for about 20-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft.
About ten minutes before removing the potatoes from the boiling water, cut
the bacon into little pieces and fry it.
Warm up the milk and mayonnaise.
Shred the cheese.
When the potatoes are done, remove all water from the pot, add the warm milk
and mayonnaise mix, add some butter, and mash with a potato masher or a
blender.
Add some salt, black pepper and garlic powder to taste and continue mashing
the mix.
Once the mix is somewhat homogeneous and the potatoes are properly mashed,
add the shredded cheese and fried bacon and mix a little.
Serve and top with chopped green onions.
