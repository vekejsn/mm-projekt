Kvass
Bring 1 L of water in a pot to a boil.
Burn black bread in a toaster or in an oven until it is thoroughly scorched to blackness on the outside.
Once the water has come to boil, remove off heat. Add burned black bread, a handful of raisins, a few slices of lemon, and coffee beans to the pot.
Leave contents of the pot to cool down to room temperature.
Filter out everything from the pot through a strainer, and pour contents into a separate, sterilized container. Add sugar and yeast into
the container, and stir until sugar is dissolved. This starts the fermentation process. The amount of sugar in this recipe should yield 1.0%-2.5% alcohol
by total volume at the end of the fermentation process.
Add rest of raisins, and non-citrus fruits of your choice. The fruits will positively impact flavour of the final product.
If mixture is not already in a mason jar, pour the mixture into a sterile mason jar, and seal the lid. Place the jar in a warm place (26-30Â°C; 79-86Â°F),
and let it ferment for a week, or until it stops bubbling.
Remove all raisins and fruits from the jar.
Squeeze lemon juice from lemons into the mixture. You may drink the now-complete kvass right away, or refrigerate it before drinking.
