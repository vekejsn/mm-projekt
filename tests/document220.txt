Tortellini
Buy tortellini (prefer meat or spinach).
Bring water to a boil.
Add salt to water only after boiling.
Add tortellini in.
Cook for 3 minutes.
Drain water from the pot while keeping tortellini in.
Add cooking cream and mix at medium heat until reduced a bit so itâ€™s more creamy.
Turn off the heat and add 1 or 2 eggs.
Mix in and let eggs cook using heat from the pot and tortellini.
Serve on a plate. Add pepper, more salt if needed, and optionally, shredded cheese on top for extra creaminess.
