Butter Chicken Masala Curry
In a bowl, mix chicken with salt, pepper, 1/2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste, 1/2 tbsp chili powder, turmeric powder, and lemon juice for the chicken marinade; let marinate for an hour.
Roast the marinated chicken in an oven at medium temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. The chicken should be three-fourths done.
Heat butter in a pan. Fry the onions until it turns translucent.
Add garlic-ginger and sautÃ© for a minute, then add garam masala. Cook for a few seconds making sure not to burn the paste.
Add tomato puree, salt, and chili powder. Let simmer for about 5 minutes, occasionally stirring until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown-red color.
Add the marinated chicken, butter, fresh cream, the crushed fenugreek leaves, and sliced green chilies. Cook for an additional 5 to 10 min until the chicken is cooked.
Adjust salt, garnish with the coriander leaves. Serve over rice or naan.
