Sunday Morning Milkshake
Chop the banana so that it fits better in the blender.
Add the banana pieces, berries, vanilla and sugar to taste to the blender.
Usually I use about 6 tea spoons of sugar.
Pour enough milk so that the mix fills a liter of the blender volume.
Blend it until the mix looks somewhat homogeneous.
Pour it and enjoy!
