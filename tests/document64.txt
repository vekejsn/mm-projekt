Basic Meatballs
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/400F
In a bowl, combine all ingredients
Hand form into balls by packing with your hands and then rolling. Set aside on a baking sheet, preferably one with a cooling rack

I prefer large meatballs (larger than a golf ball) and shoot for 16-20 for 2 lbs of meat, but if you prefer smaller meatballs you can opt for as many as 48

Either halfway through the packing process or after forming all meatballs, heat a large skillet to medium-high heat
Add 1-2 tbsp of oil to the skillet (enough to evenly coat the skillet), and bring to heat
Fill the skillet with meatballs, start by browning one face, flip once at after 2-3 minutes, and then remove to the baking sheet after another 2-3 minute. Continue in batches until all meatballs have been browned

It is OK and expected for the meatballs to lose some of their spherical shape at this point
You can skip this step and go straight the oven if you want to cut corners

Transfer to the oven, and cook until the inside registers 60Â°C/140F on an instant read thermometer. This should be about 20 minutes for large meatballs (16 per batch), maybe 10 for small (48 per batch)
Serve with pasta or on a meatball sub
