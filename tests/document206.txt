Maque Choux
Clean the corn and cut lengthwise about a thumbnail (1/4 in) from the top and scrape down using the soft end of a knife (to keep the juices).
Mix all ingredients in a bowl excluding the grease. Salt & pepper to taste.
Pour mixture into a pot with hot grease in it at low heat.
Cover pot and cook for 45 minutes, and stir as you get up for more beers.
Serve. (Serves 4-6)
