Chicken Biscuit Potpie Recipe
Preheat oven to 400Â°F (200Â°C). In a large bowl, combine the vegetables, chicken, soup and thyme. Pour into an ungreased deep-dish 9-in. pie plate. Combine the biscuit mix, milk and egg; spoon over chicken mixture.
Bake until topping is golden brown and toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25-30 minutes.
