Smoked Turkey
Mix garlic powder into the whipped butter.
Remove giblets and other materials from the turkey cavity.
Rinse the turkey and pat dry with a towel.
Liberally coat the turkey with the whipped butter mixture. Ensure the entire surface is coated.
Place turkey in a foil baking pan with mixed vegetables. If available, use a rack to elevate the turkey from the bottom of the pan.
Add chicken broth until it coats the bottom of the pan.
Cover the pan in foil.
Ignite the charcoal grill; arrange the coals for indirect cooking. Try to maintain a temperature of 300-400Â°F.
Place the turkey in pan on the grill and cook indirectly for 1 hour.
Remove the foil, and continue cooking over indirect heat.
Periodically (every 15-30 minutes) baste the turkey with its own juices. If the bottom of the pan is dry, add chicken broth and reduce heat.
Remove when the turkey reaches an internal temperature of 160Â°F in the breast.
Allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving.
