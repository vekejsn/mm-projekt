Spicy Sausage Pasta
Fry red onions with a splash of oil in a deep frying pan. Add the sausage meat (discarding the casings if need be). Add the rosemary and chilli
Increase the heat and break up the sausage meat with a wooden spoon. Once meat has browned, pour in red wine and reduce by half. Add the chopped tomatoes and reduce the sauce, uncovered, for about 30 mins. Cook the pasta according to packet instructions.
Grate the parmesan into a bowl. Drain the pasta and stir into the sauce with the parmesan, double cream and some seasoning.
Serve :)
