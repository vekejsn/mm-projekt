Spaghetti and Meatballs
Heat olive oil in a 4 to 5 quart pot on medium-high heat.
Add onions and cook for 2 minutes.
Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds longer or until fragrant.
Add the carrots and mushrooms, and cook for 2 minutes.
Add the tomato paste, stir to blend, and cook for a minute longer.
Add the canned tomatoes, basil, and parsley.
Mash and stir the tomatoes with a potato masher until the sauce starts to thicken, about 5 minutes over medium-high heat.
Reduce heat to low and simmer gently while preparing meatballs, stirring occasionally.
