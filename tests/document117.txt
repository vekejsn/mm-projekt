No-knead Bread
Mix the dry ingredients then add the hot water. It should come out as a firm dough.
Leave the dough at room temperature for 12 hours. You can then keep the dough in the fridge for up to 48 hours before cooking.

Preheat oven and pan to 450 F (230 C).
Bake for 30 minutes covered (e.g. aluminum foil), then 20 minutes uncovered.
