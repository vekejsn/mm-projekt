Banana Pancakes
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder and a little bit of salt in a large mixing bowl.
Whisk milk and egg into the flour mixture until no clumps remain in the resulting batter.
Add mashed bananas and mix well.
Add some butter to a medium warm frying pan.
Make smaller or bigger pancakes, up to you. Wait until tiny air bubbles form on top (2 to 5 minutes), turn and continue frying until the bottom is browned. Repeat.
