Marinated pork steaks
Mix olive oil, soy sauce, honey and lime juice until you have an even marinade. Add pepper and crushed garlic.
Add the pork steaks to the marinade and leave in room temperature for 30 minutes or a bit longer.
Preheat your grill/frying pan. Add marinated steaks, grill for 2 minutes, flip, repeat until youâ€™ve grilled them for 10 minutes total. Towards the last minutes pour the remaining marinade over the steaks.
Let the steaks rest for 10 minutes before serving.
