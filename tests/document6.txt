Heat up the frying pan and add some oil.
Cut the potatoes into small pieces and fry them on the frying pan over medium-heat, add some salt.
Chop the onion.
Cut the beef into small enough pieces and dust with flour.
After about 15 minutes of frying the potatoes, add the onions and beef to the pan and fry for another 10-15 minutes, or until brown.
While the beef, potatoes and onions are frying, cut the carrot and mushrooms, and chop the parsley and cilantro.
Once the beef is brown, add water to the pan, and add the rest of the ingredients, including salt, black pepper and herbs/spices to taste.
Mix thoroughly, cover the pan with a lid and stew for about 60-80 minutes over low-heat. While it is stewing, you can get back to doing some other things, like watching memes.
Remove from stove, serve hot and enjoy with some beer or cider (or your favorite beverage).
