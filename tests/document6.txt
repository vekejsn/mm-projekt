Quiche Lorraine - Lothringer KÃ¤setorte
Spread some butter on a 26cm Ã or two smaller baking tins and cover it with flour
Sieve the flour, mingle the butter/margarine in small flakes.
Form a depression in the middle of the flour and add spoons of water.
Mix all ingredients by hand until the dough becomes a homogenious mass.
Wrap the dough in aluminium foil and let it rest in the fridge for two hours (around -4 Â°C).
Preheat the oven at 200Â°C.
Spread the dough on a flour-covered surface. Roll it until it has a thickness of around 4mm. Form a crust on the sides.
Use a fork to prick the dough for a more thorough heat penetration.
Cut the ham in slices and distribute them evenly on the dough.
Divide the yolk from the egg white.
Whisk the yolk with cream.
Add the grinded cheese.
Whisk the egg white until it becomes foamy. Add it to the yolk-pepper-salt-cheese mixture.
Cover the ham in the baking tin with the mixture. Equalize the surface.
Bake the Quiche in the oven on the middle rail for 30 minutes.
After baking leave it to rest for a few minutes, then serve while it’s still warm.
I recommend serving it with a glass of white wine.
