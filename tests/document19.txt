Aussie Snags (sausage sizzle)
Chop up the onions into rings
Bring the sausages to the grill, turning once every 5 mins
Add oil of your choice to the hotplate then add the onions
Use your tongs to toss the onions until they are golden brown
When the onions are golden brown turn off the hotplate
When the sausages are cooked, butter the bread, then the onions, and add a sausage (optionally split)
Finally tomato sauce on top
