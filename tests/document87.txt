Simple Creamy Pasta Sauce
Add 1 teaspoon of flour into a saucepan.
Pour ~60ml(2fl oz|1/4 cup) of cream into a saucepan.
Stir and turn on maximum heat.
Keep stirring until it becomes thick.
If the sauce is too liquid, add more flour, if the sauce is too solid (like a uncooked pancake), add more cream.
Mix the sauce with the pasta.
