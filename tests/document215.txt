RÃ¶sti
If you don’t have cooked potatoes from the day before: Cook them and let them cool. It is important to use cold potatoes. You can also use raw potatoes. The cooking time will increase though.
Shred your potatoes with a grater. The shreds should be quite large so don’t use your typical cheese shredder.
Dice the first onion and mix together with potatoes. You can also add diced bacon if you want to. Add your seasonings here.
Heat up some butter in a large pan. Add your mix to the pan on high heat. Let the mixture get warm for a few minutes under constant stirring.
Reduce heat to medium-high. Form the RÃ¶sti into a round puck. It should fill out the whole pan. I recommend a thickness of around 1 - 1.5cm (~1/2") for a softer RÃ¶sti.
Add some more butter flakes around the inside of the pan to get it under the RÃ¶sti.
It can take quite a while for a nice crust to form. Check after roughly 5-10 minutes for browning.
While the RÃ¶sti is cooking dice the other onion and the carrots. Steam everything in a pan with a bit of water. Use a lid to get the temperature up.
Alternatively you can use fresh or creamed spinach.
When you’re satisfied with the browning, flip the RÃ¶sti and set the heat to medium-low. A plate can be useful here to put on top of the RÃ¶sti in the pan.
When the RÃ¶sti crispness is to your liking, remove from pan and fry two eggs. A runny yolk adds quite a bit to the potatoes.
Top RÃ¶sti with eggs and serve with the peas or spinach.
