Yorkshire Puddings
Preheat oven to 230Â°C / gas mark 8.
Drizzle oil into 24 ‘cupcake tin’ slots. (The pans you make cupcakes in). Heat in oven.
Pour flour into bowl.
Whisk eggs, add to bowl.
Add milk to bowl in small amounts, beating/whisking after each addition. Until there are no lumps in the batter. You may season with salt & pepper.
Tip batter into a jug so that you may pour into the cupcake pan slots evenly and carefully.
Bake undisturbed ( opening oven will impede the rising ), until the puddings have puffed up and browned.
