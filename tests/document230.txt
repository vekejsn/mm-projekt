Croutons
Preheat oven to 350Â°F (roughly 180Â°C).  Gently cut slices of white bread into squares with a chef’s knife.  One to two slices is usually enough for one person.
In a large bowl combine olive oil, spices, and bread squares and gently mix to thoroughly season bread.  Spices can be anything but I recommend oregano, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder or freshly minced garlic, and a small pinch of cayenne.
Spread seasoned bread squares large face down onto a baking sheet evenly and put in oven for 6-8 minutes.  Once the bread has crisped flip each square and put back in oven for another 6-8 minutes or until crispy throughout.
Once fully baked, let rest until cool.  These can be eaten immediately or saved in a sandwich bag for later.
