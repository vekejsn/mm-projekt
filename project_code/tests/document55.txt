Lebanese Lentil Soup
In a large pot, add lentils and water and place on medium heat to boil.
In a pan, sautÃ© onions until pink, about 5 minutes. Add chopped Swiss chard and sautÃ© together until chard is wilted, 2-3 minutes.
After lentils have cooked about 8 minutes, add onion chard mixture, along with diced potatoes and zucchini to the boiling water.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and cook until the potatoes and lentils are completely cooked, about 12 minutes.
Add the chopped cilantro. Stir and cook for about 5 minutes.
Add lemon juice and cumin before serving.
