Hellfire Steak
Rub a generous amount of salt all over the steak
Coat the entire steak with mustard powder
Pour Tabasco Sauce onto both sides of the steak, donâ€™t be afraid to put more on than you think you might otherwise be comfortable with the salt will cancel out a lot of the spice while grilling.
Grill over low heat until steak is cooked to your preference.
