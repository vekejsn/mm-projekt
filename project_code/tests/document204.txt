Japanese Noodle Soup
For the broth, add 700ml of chicken stock to a large boiling pot with the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, chinese five spice, chili, and 300ml of water.
Bring this to the boil, then turn the heat to low and simmer for around 5 mins.
Add a pinch of sugar and more soy sauce to taste
Fry the pork chops until cooked (My Sticky Pork Chops recipe works really well with this dish)
Hard boil 4 eggs.
Cook the ramen noodles as per packet instructions.
Strain the stock into another pan, then reheat.
Divide ramen between 4 bowls, then top with 1 sliced pork chop, 1/4 of the spinach (if applicable) sweetcorn, and one boiled egg (halved).
Divide the stock into the bowls, then sprinkle over sesame seeds, shredded nori and the spring onion.
