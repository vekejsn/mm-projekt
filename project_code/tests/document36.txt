Tanzanian Tea w/ Milk
Bring some hot water to boil and seep the tea. Depending on how strong you like it, you can do this for up to 10 min at most.
Be warned; typically black teas are very strong.
When done seeping, add in the milk (or cream).
Sweeten to taste. Remember you can always add more if there isnâ€™t enough.
