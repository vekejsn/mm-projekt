Beef Jerky
Mince or press garlic.
Mix all ingredients except beef to make brine.
Slice beef into Â¼" (Â½ cm) thick strips. Small chunks, about Â¾" (2 cm), of stewing beef may also be used. If possible, cut along the grain of the meat rather than across it. It may be easier to freeze the meat before attempting to cut it, as this will stop the meat pulling and deforming so easily.
Marinate meat in overnight, or at least for an hour or two.
Place meat on racks and dry in a food dehydrator at 145 Â°F (63 Â°C) for 6-8 hours. May be dried in a 150 Â°F (65 Â°C) oven with foil-covered racks. In oven, turn meat over 3-4 hours into drying time and reduce temperature to 130 Â°F (55 Â°C).
Meat should bend but not break when properly dried.
