Oatmeal Pancakes
Mix eggs, sugar, honey and milk.
In another bowl mix oat flour and baking powder.
Combine two mixtures and let the batter rest for about 15 minutes.
Preheat the pan for 5 minutes over low (~33%) heat, cook for about 1 - 1.5 minutes then flip when you see bubbles come out and cook for another 45s - 1 minute.
Eat them with raspberry (or any other) jam.
