Banana Bread
Preheat oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C)
Mix the wet ingredients (eggs, bananas, oil, sugar) in one bowl.
Mix the dry ingredients (flour, baking soda/powder, spices, salt) in another
bowl.
Slowly add the wet to the dry while mixing.
Mix until dry bits of flour are gone.
Pour into lightly buttered or oiled loaf pan.
Bake for around an hour (it’s definitely ready when a wooden skewer or
chopstick poked inside comes out clean).
