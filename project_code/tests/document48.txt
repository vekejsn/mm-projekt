Okonomiyaki
Chop cabbage into thin strips.
Whisk water and egg together in a bowl and then whisk in flour, salt, and seasonings.
Fold cabbage into batter with as few folds as possible to completely work the cabbage in.
Fry meat in a pre-heated cast-iron pan or griddle on medium-high heat until brown on one side, flip, and immediately pour batter on top after flipping.
Allow to cook for 2-3 minutes and either flip the pancake, or move under a broiler to cook the top for another 2-3 minutes.
Move pancake to a serving plate meat side up and squirt tonkatsu sauce, mayonnaise, and sriracha over the top in a zig-zag pattern
Sprinkle katsuobushi and nori on top of the sauces and the okonomiyaki is ready to serve.
