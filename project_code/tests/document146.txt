Lenten Chili
Chop the large onion and mince the garlic cloves.
On medium-low heat in a large tall pot add 2-3 tbsp olive oil.
Add the chopped onions into the pot with oil and constantly stir for 5-10 minutes until they begin to brown.
Just before onions are done add the minced garlic to the pot and let cook for 1-2 minutes.
Add the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, sweet corn, beans, and rice.
Turn up the heat to medium.
Add each of the spices, taste the chili, and adjust flavoring accordingly.
Let cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
