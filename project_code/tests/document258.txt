Oats
Bring water (with pinch of salt) to boil.
Add oats. Use a 2:1 water-to-oats ratio (by volume) for rolled oats, 3:1 for
steel cut.
Boil on medium heat until most of the water has been absorbed/evaporated.
Rolled oats will be ready quicker than steel cut.
Pour over fruit in bowl (if having fruit).
Sprinkle cinnamon (if having cinnamon).
Mix.
Add a spoonful of peanut butter (if having peanut butter).
