Pan-seared Chicken Fillet
Rinse the chicken fillets.
Remove excess moisture from the fillets by patting them with a paper towel.
If the fillets are too thick, cut them in half.
In a small container, pout enough flour and mix in paprika, garlic powder,
Provence herbs, salt, and black pepper to your liking.
Add a little cooking oil to the pan and heat it up to medium-high heat.
Coat the fillets by rolling them in the wheat mix.
Once the pan is hot, put the fillets on the pan and sear each side for about
5 minutes over medium-high heat.
As a final tip, if your fillet is too thick after all, you can just lower the
heat at the end and cook it for about 2-3 more minutes.
And thatâ€™s it. Winner winner chicken dinner!
