Merchant's Buckwheat
Chop the onion and cut the pork into small pieces.
Dust the pork with some flour. I sometimes like to do this once I’ve added
the pork to the pan, just because I am lazy and I haven’t noticed much
difference between either approach.
Heat the frying pan add a bit of oil, add the pork and onion, and fry for
about 10-15 minutes over medium-high heat.
While the pork and onion are being fried, cut the carrot into small pieces
and chop the parsley.
Once the pork and onion are fried, add the water, tomato paste, buckwheat and
carrots.
Add curcuma, chili powder, salt and black pepper to taste; mix thoroughly.
Add in the garlic cloves, bay leaves and chopped parsley.
Once the water is boiling, close the pan with a lid and stew for about 25
minutes over low heat.
Serve hot and enjoy!
