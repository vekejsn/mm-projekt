Breakfast Wrap
Begin by cutting the sausages in half and frying them ensuring that theyâ€™re cooked the whole way through.
Next, fry the bacon.
Next, possibly while the bacon is frying, crack an egg into a bowl, add a dash of milk and whisk it
Then, put the egg mixture into the microwave for a minute, take it out and whisk it again, do this twice again or until the scrambled egg is ready.
Add the sausage, bacon and scrambled egg to a wrap (I recommend two sausage halves, a bacon rasher and half the bowl of scrambled egg per wrap). Add ketchup if desired.
