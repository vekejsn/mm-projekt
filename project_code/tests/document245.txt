Almeirim Stone Soup
In a saucepan, boil the kidney beans with the pig’s ear, sausages, pork belly, onions, garlic and bay leaf in some water and add a well-washed stone. Season with the olive oil and salt and pepper to taste.
If necessary, add more water while itâs boiling.
Once the meat is cooked, take it out and reserve, then add the diced potatoes and cilantro to the pot.
Let the potatoes cook on medium to high heat for about 30-35 minutes.
Once the potatoes are well cooked, you can remove the pot from the heat, add the previously chopped meat back in and stir it well.
Pour into bowls and serve.
