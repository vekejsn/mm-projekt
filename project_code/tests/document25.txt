Mapo Tofu (éº»å©è±è)
Marinade the pork in shaoxing cooking wine, a splash of cooking oil, the soy sauce,
Add cooking oil to a wok and sear the ground pork until browned, chopping it up as it cooks
Add the doubanjiang and let it simmer for about a minute
Add the minced aromatics (ginger, garlic) scallion whites, and dou-chi and cook until fragrant
Add the stock and a splash of soy sauce, turn up the gas and bring to a boil
Add the tofu, lower the gas, and braise for around 15 mins
You’ll know it’s done when the tofu shows their trademark “pockmarks” and the seasoning sticks to them
