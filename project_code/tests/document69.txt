Asian Style Chicken with Sticky Sauce
Prepare the sauce by mixing the ingredients together in a bowl.
Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.
Place all-purpose flour in a shallow bowl. Mix in garlic powder as well as salt and pepper, 1/2 tsp each.
Place lightly beaten egg in another shallow bowl.
Coat the chicken in corn flour, dip it in egg and finally coat with seasoned all purpose-flour.
Heat a good amount of oil on a pan to fry the chicken in. The oil should be hot enough so that the chicken sizzles when placed in the pan. You may want to do this in a couple of batches depending on the size of your pan.
Fry until chicken is cooked and has a nice golden-brownish coating.
Pour out excess oil, put the sauce in and mix to coat the chicken. Or place the chicken in a bowl with kitchen towels and do another batch.
Let the sauce bubble for one or two minutes and youâ€™re done.
Serve with boiled rice.
