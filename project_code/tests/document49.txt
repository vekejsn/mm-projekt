Orange jam
Zest all fruit.
Peel off the albedo (the white part under the skin).
Blend the fruit (not too much, it doesn’t need to become an even mush, just
cut up into small pieces).
Combine the blended fruit, zest, and sugar in a pot.
Bring to boil and boil for 30-40 minutes on low heat. The mixture will
thicken as water evaporates. Note that it will thicken even further once it
cools, so don’t boil for too long - it is expected to be still a little runny
at the end of boiling.
