Chicken Pasta Casserole
Preheat oven to 400F/200C.
Dice chicken and pan cook with oil until fully cooked.
Cook the pasta for a few minutes less than usual (about 7-8 minutes).
Add chicken and pasta into a casserole dish. Mix together. Add diced tomato and shredded mozzarella cheese and keep mixing. Top with parmesan cheese and bread crumbs for an even coat. Add about a spoonful of butter evenly on the top.
Cook in the oven for 22-25 minutes, until the top looks golden.
