Mushroom Stroganov
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta al dente
In a cup, combine flour, mustard, smoked paprika, salt and pepper. Add broth and whisk until no lumps remain.
While pasta is cooking, melt butter in a medium skillet and over medium heat.
When the butter is melted, add onions and cook until softened.
Add mushrooms and cook until all water evaporates and mushrooms are slightly browned, about 7 minutes.
Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.
Pour the flour and broth mixture into the mushrooms and cook until thickens, about 2 minutes.
Stir in Creme Fraiche.
Add the strained pasta to the mushroom sauce and stir to coat the pasta completely.
Serve immediately.
