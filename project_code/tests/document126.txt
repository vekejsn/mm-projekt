Sopa de Lentejas
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
Add the onion, carrot, and bell pepper; cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the garlic, tomatoes, chorizo and bay leaf; cook about 4 minutes.
Add lentils and water (water should be about an inch deeper than the level of the lentils).
Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer, uncovered, until lentils are just cooked, 15 to 20 minutes.
