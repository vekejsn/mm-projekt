Cacio e Pepe
Cook your chosen amount of spaghetti 3-4 minutes under the time on the package
according to the directions on the package or however you usually do it. See Pasta.
Meanwhile place the peppercorns on a cutting board and mash them with a pestle.
Place half of the peppercorns in a pan and toast them at medium heat.
Drain the pasta, place it in the pan and save the boiling water for later use.
Add the pasta with the pepper with 2 spoons of the water previously saved.
Prepare the Pecorino by putting half of it a bowl with a spoon of the pasta water you saved; continue mixing the cheese with the water until a cream is formed.
When the pasta is almost cooked, add the cream and mix (you can add more water if the pasta is too dry).
Serve on a plate with the Pecorino left before on top.
