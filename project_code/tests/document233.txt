Flammkuchen
we start by flattening the dough. Even if you buy thin crust that is already sold as ‘super thin’ you have to make it even thinner. Make it so thin that you can fill 2 baking sheets with it (yes, you will make two large flammkuchen - since they are thin you need one per person) :)  I take two pieces of  parchment paper, put the dough in between and flatten it using a bottle (e.g. wine). It has to be as thin as possible (1-2 mm).
once the dough is flat, put it on your baking tray and preheat the oven at 450 to 500 Fahrenheit (230 to 260 Celsius)
distribute the sour cream evenly (it should be a very thin layer, just barely covering the dough
cut the onion and bacon into small pieces and distribute onion, bacon/vegetables (also in small pieces) evenly
put in the oven for 10 minutes and take it out when it is getting a bit dark. The thin parts will get a bit brown
put salt and pepper
