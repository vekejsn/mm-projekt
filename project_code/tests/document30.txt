In a plate, mix a little over a table spoon of spices into your flour.
Dip the chicken into the flour one strip at a time coating the entire surface.
Dip the floured chicken into the eggwash.
Press the chicken into the breadcrumbs trying to pick up as much as possible.
Repeat until all strips have been floured egged and breaded.
Coat both sides of the tenders with a light amount of vegetable oil.
