Chicken Stock or Bone Broth
Cut onions, celery and carrots into large chunks (you donâ€™t even need to remove the onion peels), add to a large empty pot (stock pot).
Add the chicken to the pot as well. It is fine to butcher the chicken to reduce its size, but include all bones and tendons as well.
Add any aromatic seasonings.
Fill the pot with water up slightly past all the ingredients.
Bring contents to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for at least 45 minutes.
You may want to remove with a spoon or other instrument the bubbles that form on the top. This will give you a clearer stock, but it is not necessary.
Strain the liquid, now stock, into another container for storage or use.
