Drunken beans (Pintos Borrachos)
SautÃ© onions.
Add garlic, sautÃ© bit longer.
Add tomatoes, water, beans, oregano, cumin, chilli powder, beer and salt, gradually bring to boil.
When boiled, reduce to simmer.
When beans are al dente (about 1 hour if using dried), bring to quick boil and evaporate remaining liquid until beans are stew-like.
Remove from the heat and mashup, or skip this step if you want more of a bean stew.
