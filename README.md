# Searching through collection of documents
This is a mathematical modeling final project.

Task desctiption:
```
Create a search engine for relevant documents by keywords with
latent semantic indexing (LSI). Methods they choose only
documents containing precisely searched words are quite inaccurate.
Namely, people use a lot of synonyms that simple methods do not
connect. The LSI method builds a model that combines multiple words into concepts and therefore
also finds documents that are relevant but do not contain a search term.
```
